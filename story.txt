Dr. Mehlhase is on her way to the airport.

But she stopped for a bratwurst on the way. 

She was running late for her flight, but wanted to get some Gebaeck so bad from a Baeckerei near the Flughafen.

As she sat eating her Apfelkuchen, she couldn't help but jam out to the dulcet tones of Rammstein over the Baeckerei speakers.

Even though the food, music, and Klimaanlage during the hot summer day were nice, she needed to make her way down the Hauptstrasse before she missed her flight.

After finishing her meal, she headed out to the parking lot and found that her car door schloss was broken.

She was wearing  her Dirndel and  Lederhose, and sat down on the ground wondering what to do now.

She called the only locksmith in Berlin, but the hunds were not open on a Sunday!

Her baby blue BMW beetle was stuck and it looked like she was going to miss her flight.

In a flash of inspiration, she returned to the Baeckerei and bought the oldest Brot they had and chiselled it into a lockpick!

Still hungry and angry she got into her Porsche, drove to Raesfeld to get the best Doener in town.

After switching cars and heading off to eat more, she realized she still had a flight to catch -- she began using her wettbewerbsfaehig GTA V skills as she careened down the highway.

Just as she was finally nearing the airport, she turned down Rammstein, turned off the air conditioning, held her breath, and got ready to run to run to the gate.

When she got to the Security line, they insisted she couldn't proceed to the gate with her Apfelkuchen, Bratwurst, and Gebaeck leftovers she had stuffed into her Dirndel pockets.

Luckily she found a stuffed Hund outside a Biergarten back near her house the night before so she could atleast find solace knowing she would have a pillow to sleep on the way.

After eating she walked past a park in Raesfeld and saw the Eltz playing a wettbewerbsfaehig game of soccer.

She is so good a soccer that the Eltz did not stand a chance against her.

Especially when she was wearing her lucky laderhosen. 

Then she went to the Flughafen with her BMW and flew back to Berlin to visit her friends.
