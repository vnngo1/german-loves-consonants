Dr. Mehlhase is on her way to the airport, but stopped for a bratwurst on the way. 

She was running late for her flight, but wanted to get some Gebaeck so bad from a Baeckerei near the Flughafen.

As she sat eating her Apfelkuchen, she couldn't help but jam out to the dulcet tones of Rammstein over the Baeckerei speakers.

Even though the food, music, and Klimaanlage during the hot summer day were nice, she needed to make her way down the Hauptstrasse before she missed her flight.

After finishing her meal, she headed out to the parking lot and found that her car door schloss was broken.
